The NASA-Cosmoboard Space Biology Dashboard is part of the 2025 NASA Space Apps Challenge. It aims to provide scientists, mission planners, and managers with a dynamic interface to explore and summarize decades of NASA bioscience publications. This project uses a context-aware search engine that compiles research papers, links each to its underlying NASA datasets, and recommends similar publications, and presents a user-friendly layout for accessing all related research with Space Biology topics.

## Project Details
Our Project connects NASA's Space Biology publications with the datasets they reference, creating an intelligent search engine that helps researchers and STEM enthusiasts easily access and explore research. We used a Flask-based backend, hosted on AWS Lambda, with a SQLite database to allow users to search publications by keywords and view a dynamically linked table. The website also runs a TF-IDF based ML recommender system to suggest the top 5 publications the user might be interested in, which saves the researcher valuable time. Our time transformed NASA archives into an interactive research network by focusing on accessibility, scalability, and ethical AI use to make an engaging user experience and make scientific discovery more collaborative.

## Tech Stack
Python, HTML, CSS, Flask, and AWS Lambda

## Use of Artificial Intelligence
After developing the frontend and backend independently, we used Cursorâ€™s AI assistance to help integrate the recommender ML model into the Flask container, ensuring each publication had its own page and relevant recommendations.
